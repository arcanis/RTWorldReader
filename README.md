# RTWorldReader

RTWorldReader is a javascript library dedicated to read and parse `.rtw` files, which are generated generated by the [Runtime World](http://runtimelegend.com/rep/rtworld/index) editor. Quite useful for 3D games, since it allows you to create your world from a full-featured editor, without having to build your own.

RTWorldReader has a built-in importer for Three.js, so that loading a world in a scene can be done in less than four lines of code:

```js
var scene = new THREE.Scene( );

RTWorldReader.loadUrl( "assets/world.rtw" ).then( function ( worldNode ) {

    var worldEntity = new RTWorldReader.ThreeEntity( worldNode );

    scene.add( worldEntity );

} );
```

**Important:** RTWorldReader only works with the latest version of Runtime World! Unfortunately, the latest official release has been made in 2012, so you will have to build the editor yourself (instructions [there](http://www.runtimelegend.com/rep/rtworld/wiki?name=Build+and+Prepare+Runtime+World)).

**Important:** Don't forget to save your maps with their extra data (BGEO, TEXD & LIMD).

## API

### Standard

#### RTWorldReader.loadUrl( url ) -> Promise< Node >

Load a world from an URL. The URL is expected returning a binary `rtw` file.

#### RTWorldReader.loadBuffer( buffer ) -> Promise< Node >

Load a world directly from the input buffer parameter.

<hr />

### Importers

#### new RTWorldReader.ThreeEntity( worldNode )

Returns a new Three.js entity, ready to be inserted in a scene. You of course need to include Three.js in order to use this element. Each entity named in the world editor will be available threw one of the following properties (`#` means 'instance') :

- `RTWorldReader.ThreeEntity#groups` (`AENT` chunks)
- `RTWorldReader.ThreeEntity#lights` (`PLGT` chunks)
- `RTWorldReader.ThreeEntity#entities` (`UENT` chunks)

You can also use `RTWorldReader.ThreeEntity#all`, which will contains a full map of the entities, regardless their type. Please note that entities other that groups, lights and user entities are not registed at all for the time being. Please open an issue if it's a problem for you.

<hr />

### For developers

#### RTWorldReader.debug

Object containing the following debug flags that you can toggle to switch verbosity :

  - `level`, can be one of the following :
      - `RTWorldReader.LOG_NONE`
      - `RTWorldReader.LOG_NOTICE`
      - `RTWorldReader.LOG_WARNING`
      - `RTWorldReader.LOG_ERROR`
      - `RTWorldReader.LOG_FATAL`
  - `loading`, boolean
  - `compiling`, boolean
  - `textures`, boolean
  - `lightmaps`, boolean
  - `brushes`, boolean

You sometime have to switch on multiple flags to display some informations.

#### new RTWorldReader.Node( [:] )

A node instance is a jQuery-like object which has the following method :

  * `array( )`
  * `get( [ n ] )`
  * `at( [ n ] )`
  * `slice( [ begin [, end ] ] )`
  * `append( item1, ... )`
  * `prepend( item1, ... )`
  * `forEach( fn, context )`
  * `map( fn, context )`
  * `filter( fn, context )`
  * `children( [ label ] )`
  * `find( label )`
  * `descendants( )`
  * `prop( name )`
  * `content( [ label ] )`

You should not have to manipulate nodes, except if you need to write your own importer. If that's what you're looking for, consider looking at the source code of bundled importers such as the [three.js one](https://github.com/arcanis/RTWorldReader/blob/master/sources/three.js) to find out how to use them. But really, it's just like a jQuery object.

## Example

You can see a live example [here](http://arcanis.github.io/RTWorldReader/example/) (source code [here](https://github.com/arcanis/RTWorldReader/blob/master/example/sources/example.js)).
