# RTWorldReader

Javascript library parsing `.rtw` files, such as the one provided by [Runtime World](http://runtimelegend.com/rep/rtworld/index).

## API

### Standard

#### RTWorldReader.loadUrl( url, callback, context )

Load a world from an URL. The URL is expected returning a binary `rtw` file.

The callback parameter will be called when opportune with the specified context. It will get two parameters : the first will be any error which could have happened, and the second will be a `Node` object if the loading succeed.

#### RTWorldReader.loadBuffer( buffer, callback, context )

Load a world from the input buffer.

The callback parameter will be called when opportune with the specified context. It will get two parameters : the first will be any error which could have happened, and the second will be a `Node` object if the loading succeed.

<hr />

### Importers

#### new RTWorldLoader.ThreeEntity( worldNode )

Returns a new Three.js entity, ready to be add in a scene.

<hr />

### For developers

#### RTWorldReader.debugMode( mode )

Enable or disable debug mode (default off). In debug mode, a lot of informations will be output. This mode is mainly used when modifying the library itself, you hopefully shouldn't have to use it.

#### new RTWorldReader.Node( [:] )

A `Node` is a jQuery-like object which has the following method :

  * `append( item1, ... )`
  * `prepend( item1, ... )`
  * `forEach( fn, context )`
  * `map( fn, context )`
  * `filter( fn, context )`
  * `children( [ label ] )`
  * `find( label )`
  * `descendants( )`
  * `prop( name )`

You should not have to manipulate nodes, except if you need to write your own importer. If you have to do it, consider looking at the source code of bundled importers such as the [three.js one](https://github.com/arcanis/RTWorldReader/blob/master/sources/three.js) to find out how to use them. But really, it's just like a jQuery object.
